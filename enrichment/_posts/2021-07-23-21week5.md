> “Can You Hear Me Now?” is one of the best online team building games.
> You play this game in a virtual conference room, and nominate one person to be the speaker and the rest are artists.
> The speaker uses a random image generator to source a suitable image, and the goal is to describe that image in such a way that the artists can draw it successfully.
>
> The one guideline is the speaker must only use geometric shapes. For example, you could say “draw a large circle and then three equidistant triangles” but not “write the letter E.”
> By limiting instructions, the speaker needs to exercise extremely accurate communication skills, and the artists need to listen and interpret.
