It's that most wonderful time of year --- grant reporting season for the WAVES Workshop!
A time to reflect on the accomplishments of the workshop and record them for the benefit of postererity.
(Oh, and for NSF administrators too!)
I thought I'd take a moment to share the blurb on WAVES outcomes we prepared for this year's Active LENS grant annual report.
I've tucked in the 2020 blurb, too, further down below.

## 2021 Report

> This year, we reprised a major initiative that we introduced in 2020 in response to the cancellation of many undergraduate internships: a full-remote software development workshop—Workshop for Avida-ED Software (WAVES).
> The goal of the workshop is four-fold:
> 1. to help participants advance their careers by skillbuilding through hands-on C++ and/or JavaScript software development, with a special focus on supporting members of historically underrepresented groups in computer science,
> 2. to catalyze effective science communication and science pedagogy by helping participants develop the know-how to showcase their research through interactive web applications,
> 3. to jumpstart software development on web framework and core digital evolution tools in support of the next version of the Avida-ED scientific and educational software, and
> 4. to produce software that broadly enriches the digital evolution, scientific, education, and open-source communities. to provide a learning opportunity for undergraduate CS majors, especially ones from underrepresented groups.
>
> The cornerstone of participants’ educational outcomes was one-on-work with an assigned graduate student or faculty mentor on a project of mutual choosing.
> Eight mentors participated in the program, leading projects ranging from algorithm design, to web design, to documentation and testing.
> Some participants --- like Yemi Shin, who worked with Dr. Diane Blackwood to incorporate touch device support--- developed software explicitly tailored for Avida-ED.
> Other participants --- like Tait Weicht, who worked with Matthew Andres Moreno to continue work on a C++ interface for mobile-friendly web design --- developed more general software tools that will directly support Avida-ED but have more general applicability.
> Each participant wrote a blog post summary of their project.
> (A full listing of blog posts is available at <{{ site.url }}/blog.html>.)
>
> To bring students up to speed with technical skills for their projects, we began the workshop with a one-week series of asynchronous tutorials introducing Avida-Ed, C++, and web design.
> (A full listing of tutorials is available at <{{ site.url }}/tutorials.html>.)
> In addition to these tutorials, participants broadened their scientific and technical horizons through topic-driven enrichment seminars.
> These seminars were held for 90 minutes on a weekly basis.
> (A full listing of enrichment sessions available at <{{ site.url }}/enrichment.html>.)
> We also held weekly group meetings with breakout sessions to check in on student progress, troubleshoot barriers, and spitball ideas. We assessed a pre- and post-survey of participants to quantify learning outcomes.
> We look forward to completing our analysis of learning outcomes in the upcoming weeks.
>
> We hosted 10 participants.
> (A directory of our participants, including a brief biographical sketch for each, is available at <{{ site.url }}/people.html>.)
>
> Five participants identified as women (50%).
> Five participants identified as men (50%).
> One participant identified as Korean (10%), one identified as Vietnamese (10%), two identified as Other Asian (20%), and eight identified as White (80%).
> Three participants identified as LGBTQIAP (30%).
> One participant identified as first-generation (10%).
> A majority of our participants --- 7 out of 10 (70%) --- were members of an underrepresented group in computer science.

## 2020 Report

> COVID-19 caused the cancellation of many undergraduate internships and we decided to offer an on-line software development workshop—Workshop for Avida-ED Software (WAVES)—to provide a learning opportunity for undergraduate CS majors, especially ones from underrepresented groups.
> As with our faculty workshop, this was done entirely online.
>
> The cornerstone of participants’ educational outcomes was one-on-work with an assigned graduate student or faculty mentor on a project of mutual choosing.
> Thirteen mentors participated in the program, leading projects ranging from algorithm design, to web design, to education and social science.
> Some participants --- like Raheem Clemmons, who worked with Dr. Diane Blackwood to build a drag-and-drop framework --- developed software explicitly tailored for Avida-ED.
> Other participants --- like Sara Boyd, who worked with Matthew Andres Moreno to build a C++ interface for mobile-friendly web design --- developed more general software tools that will directly support Avida-ED but have more general applicability.
> Each participant wrote a blog post summary of their project.

>
> Ten participants identified as women (59%).
> Seven participants identified as men (41%).
> Three participants (18%) identified as of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish Origin.
> Three participants identified as Black or African-American (18%), one identified as Asian Indian (6%), two identified as Chinese (12%), and twelve identified as White (71%).
> One participant identified as a first-generation college student (6%).
> A majority of our participants --- 13 out of 17 (76%) --- were members of an underrepresented group in computer science.
