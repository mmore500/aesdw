## Introduction
-what is MABE2
For our project, we focused our work mostly on 
-improving the end user experience through the development of DynamicOrg.
-adding support for brains and genomes, both of which have base classes

## DynamicOrg / author: mitchell
-what is an organism in MABE2 and how it was originally used to create an expiriment
-how DynamicOrg makes the entire process of designing, implementing, and running an expiriment much easier

## Brains and Genomes / author: jamie
-how new brain and genome functionality was implemented before we made the switch
-how/where the functionality lives now, how its better this way

## Tutorial - creating and running Aagos using DynamicOrg / author: mitchell
-explanation of aagos and how it works
-writing the evaluator
-writing the aagos brain
-putting it all together in the .gen file -> .mabe file
-running the expiriment

## Conclusion
-reiterate how our work greatly simplified the end user expirience using mabe2

## Future plans / Work we didn't complete
-anything we wish we could have completed but didn't have time to
