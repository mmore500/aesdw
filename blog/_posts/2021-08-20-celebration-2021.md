Well, here we are again.
Another excellent WAVES workshop in the rear view mirror!
I've had a great few months working with all our participants and mentors --- tracking your progress on hands-on software development work and seeing you all at our check-in meetings and enrichment seminars.

We got together for a (virtual) celebration this morning to toast everyone's hard work & achievement over the course of the workshop.
We invited participants and mentors to submit gifs or memes that they felt represented their WAVES experience ahead of time.
I threw them in a slide show and had everyone give a thirty second-ish explanation of their image & say anything else they wanted to to the group --- followed, of course, by a hearty round of poetry-slam style snaps!
